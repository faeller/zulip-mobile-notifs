AutoName: Zulip Notifications

Summary: Instant push notifications for Zulip via long-polling

Description: |
  Unofficial notification app for Zulip that delivers instant push
  notifications without relying on Google's push services.

  Features:
  * Instant notifications for DMs and @mentions
  * Runs in background with minimal battery usage
  * Credentials stored locally on your device
  * Supports password, SSO, and zuliprc authentication
  * Notification filters (mute channels, topics, quiet hours)
  * Custom notification sounds
  * Multi-account support

  How it works:
  Uses Zulip's event queue API with long-polling to receive messages
  in real-time. A lightweight foreground service keeps the connection alive.

  This app is not affiliated with Zulip.
