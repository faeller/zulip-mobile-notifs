Unofficial notification app for Zulip that delivers instant push notifications without relying on Google's push services.

Features:
• Instant notifications for DMs and @mentions
• Runs in background with minimal battery usage
• Credentials stored locally on your device
• Supports password, SSO, and zuliprc authentication
• Notification filters (mute channels, topics, quiet hours)
• Custom notification sounds
• Multi-account support

How it works:
Uses Zulip's event queue API with long-polling to receive messages in real-time. A lightweight foreground service keeps the connection alive.

This app is not affiliated with Zulip. It's an independent project to solve unreliable push notifications on the official app.
